# Project-S
A different approach to a snake game. Made with LÖVE!

# Running
* Install LÖVE on your machine (https://love2d.org/)
* Download this repo. (Download Zip)
* Extract that folder, compress the folder's contents in a way that, when you open the zip file, main.lua and everything else is at root.
* Rename the compressed.zip to something.love and run that.
